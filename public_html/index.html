<h1>Public Drawpile Server</h1>

<p>This is a free to use <a href="https://drawpile.net/">Drawpile</a> server.
To <a href="https://drawpile.net/help/hosting/">host a session</a> here, select the <i>Remote</i> option
in the Host dialog and enter <code>pub.drawpile.net</code> in the text box.</p>

<p>This public server is provided primarily for the benefit of those who are unable to host sessions
on their own computers. It has limited capacity, so please be considerate of others and
try not to monopolize the available space.</p>

<p>Sessions hosted (or just listed) here should abide by the <a href="https://drawpile.net/communities/drawpile.net/ccg/">common community guidelines</a>.</p>
